# PokerPredicter

In this scrip I am using tensorflow to make a AI model that predictes the chance of you wining the hand just based on your start hand in poker. This is my first machin learing model useing tensorflow and it is a simple nural network that has two layers the hidden layer takes advantage of the ReLU activation while my output layer uses sigmoid.

I also made a second part of the scrip that adds data two the csv file based on the hand that I am playing to make it easery to collect data.
